# Radical Revisions: Becoming a Software Developer

On top of my desk shamefully sat the pages of my first collegiate essay. Each paragraph was
doused in scarlet red-pride-piercing commentary. A radical revision is what my professor
coined it. To radically revise, she said, is to let your first draft completely succumb to artistic
transfiguration. She was asking me to venture beyond the norm, but all I could do was wander
into confusion asking how could this happen to me. I guess the more insightful question would
have been how could it not happen to me? My life and the people in it are constantly revising.
My father spent his 20’s as a revolutionary social activist, his 40’s as a destructive politician,
and his 60’s as a laborious factory worker. My mother determinedly graduated with a bachelors
in nursing, gradually matured into a business manager, and ultimately evolved into a
homemaker.

My own drafting started at an early age. I was a product of the ‘Black Bottoms’ of East Side
Russellville, Kentucky where afternoons meant sitting crossed-legged eating watermelon on
the rooftop, flying wide armed roller skating on the cracked pavements, and sauntering pigeon
footed on the Hampton Park basketball court. Later, I would attend highschool at The Gatton Academy of
Math and Science where evenings meant sitting crossed legged studying for exams on my
roommates’ bed, flying wide armed running to class on the campus grounds, and sauntering
pigeon footed on classroom building rooftops.

Most memorably, it was at Gatton Academy that I took my first computer science course, and
ironically, had developed a repulsion to computer science. Lectures felt as if my German
professor was actually teaching in German. Hours of spending time in my professors’ office,
hours of being glued to the side of my school tutor, and hours of endlessly studying in the
school library had easily convinced me to eternally part ways with such a worthy adversary.
I did not part ways for long, very short of eternity, when my next radical revision was etched.
Computer science would become my major during my sophomore year at Columbia University.
I had entered college with the intent of studying Civil Engineering, but every engineering textbook I 
opened immediately lured me to sleep. I was exhausted from the pressures of varsity athletics,
requirements of the engineering curriculum, and demands of the college social scene. Yet my
computer science projects were the only assignments that could snap me out of induced
narcolepsy. The concepts finally came alive and I found myself teaching classmates and
spending nights engrossed in extra credit assignments.

My next draft was written when I joined cloud computing at Goldman Sachs where we offer
Compute as a Service. My days are spent developing new features, assisting clients, and
maintaining our ecosystem. In this space, I am required to be more than just a machine that
pushes out software. I am charged with understanding the business holistically. Most
surprisingly, my role extends beyond being a developer hiding behind a desk. I am constantly
collaborating across divisions, arguing new system implementations among my teammates,
and challenging the status quo within the firm. Although I have matured into my role, 
it was not an easy transition. Upon joining my current team, I was assigned as co-lead 
of a new project, while concurrently learning the financial and technological facets of
Goldman Sachs. I was developing at scale, juggling multiple assignments and proposing design 
strategies in an arena where I was the freshmen. Despite my less than smooth transition, 
every deadline missed, every build broken, and every code review received has taught me to develop 
the confidence I have as a developer today.

I would be remiss not to mention the role identity and culture has played into my integration at
Goldman Sachs. I am in a unique position in society as well industry. I work within finance and
technology, both white male-dominated fields. I am black and a woman, both bottom rungs on
the social ladder. I have been blessed with amazing mentors and management that have
cultivated a world around me where these embedded social rungs appear less important. Not
only have I slowly began to discover where my personal and career identities align, but I am
discovering where my identity lies in the technology industry in its entirety. We often hear about
technology mongols Bezos or Zuckerberg. But it is not often that we hear about pioneers in
sustainable technology such as Devaki Raj or Iyinoluwa Aboyeji. There is a growing movement
for building technology that maintains consciousness and is committed to empowering the
disenfranchised. Within this movement, I have found a resonance that I am anxious to engage
in.

Lastly, the less than exciting part of my job is refactoring legacy code. Refactoring is in
essence “radically revising” numerous lines of code. As a result, the overall performance and
readability of an application should be improved. I have learned that my best-refactoring jobs
occur when I stop focusing on the implementation and internalize the purpose of a code
segment. Convoluted implementations can always detour a developer down a frustrating path
of confusion. But, the purpose will never lead one astray. In my personal refactoring, I equate
my legacy with being a daughter, a sister, a product, a scholar, a friend. My purpose is driven
by the polarity between ‘The Black Bottoms’ and “The Academy” revealing the need for
educational reform. Computer Science has proven a tool for me to refactor or rather, radically
revise in my own life. The implementation is still uncertain, but when drafting future chapters
that detail challenging the status quo of society, technology is a worthy adversary.
